# Matrix Class Implementation

This project was to implement a Matrix Class in Python which includes different methods to calculate:

1- determinant
2- Trace
3- Inverce
4- Transpose
5- Add              (overloading + operator)
6- subtraction      (overloading - operator)
7- multiplication   (overloading * operator)

# the Goal of Implementing this Matrix Class

to be able to calculate the necessary Kalman Filter functions in Prediction and Update
